If anyone ever wanted to make projects with 7 segment displays, I made an library for that.
Use this tool to print your desired numbers: index.html file.
## Notes
If you downloaded library before November 12, download it again.
## Installation
Download .ZIP file. Then go to Arduino IDE, and add ZIP library.
## Functions
In this library, there are 3 main functions:
### displayShowNumbers("0000", "////");
This functios print numbers. Here are parameters: You obviously need numbers to show (In this case they are 0000) and dots(In function ////). This is how to add dots after numbers. If  you want dots after number you type ".", and if you don't "/". TThat should repeat 4 times.

### displayShowCharacter(0B11001100);
This function
